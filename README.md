# ðŸ¤– Robot Arm Control Panel

This project is a control panel for a robot arm built using **Flutter** for the frontend and **PHP + MySQL** for the backend. The system allows the user to control four servo motors, save poses to a database, run saved poses, and delete them.

---

## ðŸ§  What This Project Does

- Control 4 servo motors using sliders.
- Save the current pose (servo positions) to a MySQL database.
- View saved poses in a scrollable list.
- Run a specific saved pose (loads the servo values into the UI).
- Delete any saved pose.

---

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Flutter (Dart)
- **Backend:** PHP
- **Database:** MySQL (via MAMP)
- **Local Server:** MAMP (for macOS)

How I Made the Task

 1. Created the UI Using Flutter

- Used `Slider` widgets for servo 1 to 4.
- Buttons for `Reset`, `Save Pose`, `Run`.
- Used a `ListView` to display saved poses.
- Added HTTP communication using `http` package.

 2. Used MySQL Database (`TASK3`) from previous task

 3. Wrote the Backend in PHP (in /web_task3)
    - save_pose.php â€” inserts a new pose into pose table.
    - get_saved_poses.php â€” fetches all saved poses as JSON.
    - get_run_pose.php â€” returns a pose by ID.
    - delete_pose.php â€” deletes a pose by ID.
    - update_status.php â€” sets status = 0 for a pose.

   
 4. Connected Flutter to PHP
    - Used real IP from ipconfig getifaddr en0 to make Flutter send HTTP requests to MAMP backend.
    - All buttons are linked to HTTP POST or GET endpoints.
    - Poses are displayed dynamically using data from MySQL.
